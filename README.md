# Sit On Chair
My first ever web project "Sit on Chair" was created during Coders Lab course. I used HTML and CSS3. This is first step in my portfolio.
I started learning HTML and CSS a few months ago and now I can make website as you can see.
I had only screenshot of website and based on my knowledge I had to make this website.
The big challenge for me was to make dropdown menu, but eventually I was successful.

## Used technologies
In my project I made use of, among other things:
HTML:
+ tags: header, section, footer, form, nav, button
+ attributes: class, href, alt

CSS:
+ z-index
+ display: flex
+ position: absolute, relative, fixed
+ pseudoclasses: :hover, :checked
+ pseudoelements ::before, ::after

and many more.

This project will be developed and expanded by JavaScript.
